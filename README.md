# Incident Reporting System

## Project Description
The Incident Reporting System is a forensic documentation application designed to formally record, store, and track security incidents. It helps investigators document incident details, assess impact, preserve evidence, record resolutions, and maintain forensic integrity using digital signatures.

This project is developed as part of the HackerHub8 LLP Internship Program.



## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Requests library
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub



## Features
- Incident reporting form
- Impact assessment
- Evidence documentation
- Resolution tracking
- Digital signature for investigators
- Secure incident record storage in JSON format
